    "ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It combines three components:\n",
    "- AR (AutoRegressive): Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations.\n",
    "- I (Integrated): Uses differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "- MA (Moving Average): Uses dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Smoothing:\n",
    "Exponential Smoothing methods apply weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older.\n",
    "- Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES): Suitable for data without trend or seasonality.\n",
    "- Double Exponential Smoothing (DES): Suitable for data with a trend but no seasonality.\n",
    "- Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES): Suitable for data with both trend and seasonality.\n",
