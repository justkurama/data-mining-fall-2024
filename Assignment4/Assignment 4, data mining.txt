Exercise 1: Anomaly Detection
Objective: Implement an anomaly detection system using Python libraries.
Tasks:
1. Data Collection:
   * Use a publicly available dataset (e.g., KDD Cup, Credit Card Fraud Detection) or generate synthetic data for anomaly detection.
   * Load the dataset using pandas and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Data Preprocessing:
   * Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
   * Normalize or standardize features as necessary.
3. Anomaly Detection Techniques:
   * Implement at least two different anomaly detection algorithms, such as:
      * Statistical Method: Use Z-score or IQR for univariate anomaly detection.
      * Machine Learning Method: Implement Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM from scikit-learn.
      * Deep Learning Method: Build an autoencoder for anomaly detection.
4. Model Evaluation:
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   * Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
5. Visualization:
   * Use matplotlib or seaborn to visualize the detected anomalies against the normal data points.
   * Create plots that showcase the distribution of features and the anomalies.
6. Reporting Findings:
   * Summarize the detection results, including the number of detected anomalies and the effectiveness of each method.
Exercise 2: Time Series Analysis
Objective: Analyze and forecast a time series dataset using Python libraries.
Tasks:
1. Data Collection:
   * Select a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data, or sales data).
   * Load the dataset using pandas and perform initial EDA.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   * Handle any missing values in the time series data.
   * Resample the data to a uniform time interval if necessary (e.g., daily, weekly).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   * Visualize the time series data using line plots to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.
   * Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals using seasonal decomposition.
4. Modeling:
   * Implement forecasting techniques, such as:
      * ARIMA Model: Fit an ARIMA model to the data and determine the appropriate parameters (p, d, q).
      * Exponential Smoothing: Use Holt-Winters method for forecasting seasonal data.
      * Machine Learning Approach: Implement a model using scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM for deep learning).
5. Model Evaluation:
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   * Evaluate the forecast accuracy using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
   * Visualize the predicted vs. actual values.
6. Reporting Findings:
   * Summarize the results of the analysis, including the accuracy of different forecasting methods and insights gained from the time series analysis.
